If an applicant intends to open a bank account in Italy and bring their 
family members to the country, they shall first have Italian residence 
registration . For this purpose, it is necessary to purchase real estate 
or conclude a long -term rental agreement.
Having been registered, an applicant is able to open bank accounts 
in Italy and submit a request for family reunification. The request 
shall be sent after the main applicant receives a residence permit.
However, such requests can take quite a long time to be processed 
and family reunification can take as much as 1 year.
The easiest and fastest scenario is for family members to arrive on a 
tourist visa.
In this case, the whole family applies for a residence permit in Italy 
together at the same time as the main applicant.14Bank account opening and 
family reunification

What is citizenship 
by investment? 
Citizenship  by Investment  is a process  of obtaining a second  passport 
by investing  significant  amount  of funds . Such investments  could  be:
-non- refundable  donation to the state  that contributes  towards  the 
economic growth of  the host country
-Investment  in approved real  estate  projects .
Dual citizenship  gives  successful applicants  the right  to live, work  and 
invest  in their host country , while  benefiting  from  the country’s  unique  
passport privileges . The unique  advantages  that come  with second  
citizenship  make  it an attractive  option for entrepreneurs  and investors  
in search  of financial freedom , and families seeking  better  
opportunities  and a safer  future.

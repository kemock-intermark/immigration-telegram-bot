Citizenship by Investment is a process of obtaining a second passport 
by investing significant amount of funds. Such investments could be:

economic growth of the host country
-Investment in approved real estate projects.
Dual citizenship gives successful applicants the right to live, work and 
invest in their host country , while benefiting from the country’s unique 
passport privileges. The unique advantages that come with second citizenship make it an attractive option for entrepreneurs and investors in search of financial freedom , and families seeking better 
opportunities and a safer future.
